Anyone who is in the process of learning to code or simply sharpen their skills is likely to have come across <a href=https://www.codewars.com> codewars</a> at some point.  For me it was no different, I soon found myself taking on the challenges and pushing myself to see how I could solve each Kata.  It was daunting at first but after successfully passing the initial test challenges I was on my way to pushing my rank up. 

One of the most challenging parts of the kata can simply come down to understanding the task description.  Although this can be frustrating, it actually ends up being a good glimpse into the real world of coding and understanding the brief.  Once I was able to get stuck into the challenge I would soon find myself adjusting my code through trial and error as I aimed to pass each of the test requirements.

Once I had my code completed and passing all tests it has always been interesting to see how others would tackle the same problem.  Seeing results of 1 or 2 lines of code when I had solved the problem with 8 lines was disheartening at first but you soon come to realise that those two lines may not be the best solution when you are trying to write code in a way that is also easy for others to understand what you are doing.

Codewars has and will continue to be a great way for me to hone my skills as a developer and adapt to new ways of problem solving.
